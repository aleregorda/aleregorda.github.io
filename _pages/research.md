  <small>We adapt 2D thermomechanical numerical models of rifting on Earth to Venus to study how the observed rifting structures on the Venusian surface could have been formed. More specifically, we aim to investigate how rifting evolves under the Venusian surface conditions and the proposed lithospheric structure. Our results show that a strong crustal rheology such as diabase is needed to localize strain and to develop a rift under the high surface temperature and pressure of Venus. The evolution of the rift formation is predominantly controlled by the crustal thickness, with a 25 km-thick diabase crust required to produce mantle upwelling and melting. The surface topography produced by our models fits well with the topography profiles of the Ganis and Devana Chasmata for different crustal thicknesses. We therefore speculate that the difference in these rift features on Venus could be due to different crustal thicknesses. Based on the estimated heat flux of Venus, our models indicate that a crust with a global average lower than 35 km is the most likely crustal thickness on Venus.</small>
